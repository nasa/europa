Brief Migration Notes

$Id: MigrationNotes,v 1.6 2004-12-07 00:39:34 wedgingt Exp $

This file is intended to help users of the prior Europa (in the
NewPlan CVS tree) planning system migrate their projects to this
version, Europa2 (informally known as PLASMA during its initial
development, which is still in progress at this time).

This is a draft document likely to be modified fairly often as issues
are noticed.  New issues are likely to be simply appended to the end
without regard to importance or any other criteria, at least until the
first official release of Europa2.

There are several references to GNATS below; see the README file for
the URL of the GNATS database.

1. Explicit bounds on timepoints of tokens (whether between two tokens
or to absolute time values) are not supported by Europa2 in XML
transaction files.  This may be an issue when translating NewPlan
style initial state files to NDDL or to XML transaction files.  See
also GNATS 2708.

2. In NewPlan, there is only one (C++) class Domain.  In Europa2, there
are many: EnumeratedDomain, StringDomain, SymbolDomain, ObjectDomain,
IntervalDomain, IntervalIntDomain, etc.  Also, each enumeration (label
set, in NewPlan terms) will have its own C++ class for its domains.

3. For several reasons, re-using (C++) domain variables is not as
simple as in NewPlan.  First, assigning or specifying a domain will
error out if it is not a subset of the previously specified domain;
the domain must be reset (member function "reset()") in between such
specifications.  Second, open domains can be closed but cannot be
re-opened.  That, in turn, implies that propagation does not restrict
variables with open domains, because backtracking the closures is not
supported.  Third, changing the type of a C++ domain variable is, of
course, not possible during run time but could be "simulated" in
NewPlan because all C++ domain variables were of the single C++ class
Domain.

4. In Europa2, when the domain of the object variable of a token is
closed but not singleton, then asking any of the objects in that
domain for the list of associated tokens will include the token.  This
is very different from the behavior of NewPlan, for which such queries
only return the tokens that have already been inserted onto a timeline
of the object.  (see also GNATS 2704).

5. In NewPlan, label sets imply a "default ordering" heuristic based
on the order they are given when the label set is declared.  This
behavior is not duplicated in Europa2, for which the "default
ordering" heuristic would be order of creation of the corresponding
LabelStr instance due to internals of how the C++ classes
EnumeratedDomain and LabelStr are implemented.

6. The number of plan steps for otherwise identical problems will
almost certainly be larger with Europa2 (PLASMA) than with Europa
(NewPlan) whenever tokens are involved due to changes in how tokens
are supported and change from creation to insertion, merge, or
rejection.

7. NewPlan/ModelLoader/converter/convert2 can be used to read a DDL
file (including any DDL files that it includes) and produce a single
NDDL file for use with Europa2.

8. NewPlan's ConstraintTokens are not supported by Europa2, though the
convert2 program will not complain about them (the NDDL compiler will,
at least whenever there is a choice between two or more predicates
because it is a ConstraintToken rather than a ValueToken).

9. The NewPlan makefiles are designed to notice when the compiler
version and other build options are changed and, when appropriate,
modify an include file that, due to the dependencies in the makefiles
(including many generated automatically via the compiler), will cause
most everything to be recompiled.  There is nothing similar in the
PLASMA jam files, so 'jam clean' (with appropriate -s options) needs
to be run after changing any of the compilers being used (including,
usually, the version of the compilers).  PLASMA's independent naming
of files resulting from the different compilation variants mitigates
but does not preclude this problem.

10. In the DDL language used with Europa (CVS module name NewPlan),
temporal constraints can only be made between master tokens and their
slave (or subgoal) tokens, but they can also have explicit intervals.
They are otherwise the same as in Europa2 (which will support
intervals, but already has other, more explicit, ways of specifying
temporal - and other - constraints).

Note that these temporal relation names are the same in Europa1
(NewPlan) and Europa2 (PLASMA); thus, this is not a "translation
table" from DDL to NDDL, but rather a description of what the relation
names mean in terms of actual constraints when explicit intervals are
involved.

Europa Name         Implied Constraints
-----------         -------------------
after               slave.end + interval = master.start
before              master.end + interval = slave.start
contained_by        slave.start + interval1 = master.start, master.end + interval2 = slave.end
contains            master.start + interval1 = slave.start, slave.end + interval2 = master.end
contains_end        master.start + interval1 = slave.end, slave.end + interval2 = master.end
contains_start      master.start + interval1 = slave.start, slave.start + interval2 = master.end
ends_after          slave.end + interval = master.end
ends_after_start    slave.start + interval = master.end
ends_before         master.end + interval = slave.end
ends_during         slave.start + interval1 = master.end, master.end + interval2 = slave.end
paralleled_by       slave.start + interval1 = master.start, slave.end + interval2 = master.end
parallels           master.start + interval1 = slave.start, master.end + interval2 = slave.end
starts_after        slave.start + interval = master.start
starts_before       master.start + interval = slave.start
starts_before_end   master.start + interval = slave.end
starts_during       slave.start + interval1 = master.start, master.start + interval2 = slave.end

All the intervals default to [0 +Inf] in DDL models (and presumably in
NDDL, once it supports explicit intervals).  Thus, if no explicit
interval is given in a DDL model, the "translation" to NDDL is simply
to use the same temporal relation name between the token names.

The names are intended to make sense when read as "Master <name> slave"
(or "Goal <name> subgoal") or, with an explicit interval, "Master <name>
slave by between 5 and 10 inclusive" (e.g.).

Also, there are several abbreviations of commonly used temporal
relations that would otherwise require explicit intervals.  As before,
these have the same meaning in Europa1 and Europa2.

Europa Abbreviation             Expands to
-------------------             ----------
any                             parallels [-Inf +Inf] [-Inf +Inf]
ends                            ends_before [0 0]
equal                           contains [0 0] [0 0]
meets                           before [0 0]
met_by                          after [0 0]
starts                          starts_before [0 0]

Finally, as an example of a temporal relation with an explicit interval,
presently only supported in Europa1 (NewPlan):

Europa1 DDL			NDDL Constraints
-----------			----------------
after [5 10]			EqualSum(Master.start, [5 10], Slave.end);
