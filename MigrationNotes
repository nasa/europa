Brief Migration Notes

$Id: MigrationNotes,v 1.4 2004-12-02 01:16:08 wedgingt Exp $

This file is intended to help users of the prior Europa (in the
NewPlan CVS tree) planning system migrate their projects to this
version, Europa2 (informally known as PLASMA during its initial
development, which is still in progress at this time).

This is a draft document likely to be modified fairly often as issues
are noticed.  New issues are likely to be simply appended to the end
without regard to importance or any other criteria, at least until the
first official release of Europa2.

There are several references to GNATS below; see the README file for
the URL of the GNATS database.

1. Explicit bounds on timepoints of tokens (whether between two tokens
or to absolute time values) are not supported by Europa2 in XML
transaction files.  This may be an issue when translating NewPlan
style initial state files to NDDL or to XML transaction files.  See
also GNATS 2708.

2. In NewPlan, there is only one (C++) class Domain.  In Europa2, there
are many: EnumeratedDomain, StringDomain, SymbolDomain, ObjectDomain,
IntervalDomain, IntervalIntDomain, etc.  Also, each enumeration (label
set, in NewPlan terms) will have its own C++ class for its domains.

3. For several reasons, re-using (C++) domain variables is not as
simple as in NewPlan.  First, assigning or specifying a domain will
error out if it is not a subset of the previously specified domain;
the domain must be reset (member function "reset()") in between such
specifications.  Second, open domains can be closed but cannot be
re-opened.  That, in turn, implies that propagation does not restrict
variables with open domains, because backtracking the closures is not
supported.  Third, changing the type of a C++ domain variable is, of
course, not possible during run time but could be "simulated" in
NewPlan because all C++ domain variables were of the single C++ class
Domain.

4. In Europa2, when the domain of the object variable of a token is
closed but not singleton, then asking any of the objects in that
domain for the list of associated tokens will include the token.  This
is very different from the behavior of NewPlan, for which such queries
only return the tokens that have already been inserted onto a timeline
of the object.  (see also GNATS 2704).

5. In NewPlan, label sets imply a "default ordering" heuristic based
on the order they are given when the label set is declared.  This
behavior is not duplicated in Europa2, for which the "default ordering"
heuristoc would be lexicographic (based on ASCII code) due to
internals of how the C++ classes EnumeratedDomain and LabelStr are
implemented.

6. The number of plan steps for otherwise identical problems will
almost certainly be larger with Europa2 (PLASMA) than with Europa
(NewPlan) whenever tokens are involved due to changes in how tokens
are supported.

7. NewPlan/ModelLoader/converter/convert2 can be used to read a DDL
file (including any DDL files that it includes) and produce a single
NDDL file for use with Europa2.

8. NewPlan's ConstraintTokens are not supported by Europa2, though the
convert2 program will not complain about them (the NDDL compiler will,
at least whenever there is a choice between two or more predicates
because it is a ConstraintToken rather than a ValueToken).

9. The NewPlan makefiles are designed to notice when the compiler
version and other build options are changed and, when appropriate,
modify an include file that, due to the dependencies in the makefiles
(including many generated automatically via the compiler), will cause
most everything to be recompiled.  There is nothing similar in the
PLASMA jam files, so 'jam clean' (with appropriate -s options) needs
to be run after changing any of the compilers being used (including,
usually, the version of the compilers).  PLASMA's independent naming
of files resulting from the different compilation variants mitigates
but does not remove this problem.
