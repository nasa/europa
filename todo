Code base management & cleanup:
1. Break out Europa dependencies
2. Split out core vs. components in all cases
3. Split out tests from other aspects in all cases
4. Split out utilities
5. Ensure builds can occur at all levels - improved target location
6. Clean up target list and publish in the root Jam file
7. Switch to new error handling mechanism, with helpful output on failure.
8. Add tests to force errors.
9. Come up with Project Name and build proper CVS database
10. Add wrapper functions for all constants as required by VxWorks
11. Clean up the mechanism for registration of constraints for components. They are buried. Possible use a config.xml structure.

NddlCompiler:
1. Remove error messages printing out enumerations
2. Implement rule compilation to handle object references
3. Add guarded expression handling in rules
4. Support nested guarded expressions
5. Implement unary constraints
6. Create configuration file for all concrete instances, at least define them in one place

Testing support:
1. Find a way to export initial states from Europa and translate them.
2. Ensure that all models from DDL can be converted to nddl and compiled.

System Tests:
1. Get a multi-step plan running clean from .nddl file all the way through
2. Test nominal planning process - sub-goal to completion. no back-tracks.
3. Test back-tracking
4. Generate models from DDL samples, and dumn

Parallel Efforts:
1. Port of Nddl parser to Java and extraction from 
2. Integration of Resources (include changes to NddlCompiler)
3. Integration of Temporal Network, including incorporation of helper methods to prune token ordering choices.
4. Add support for serialization.

PlanWorks Convergence:
1. Switch to Jam build system (evaluate at least)
