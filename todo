Code base management & cleanup:
1. Ensure builds can occur at all levels - improved target location
2. Clean up target list and publish in the root Jam file
3. Switch to new error handling mechanism, with helpful output on failure.
4. Add tests to force errors.
5. Add wrapper functions for all constants as required by VxWorks
6. Clean up the mechanism for registration of constraints for components. They are buried. Possible use a config.xml structure.
7. Document code

NddlCompiler:
1. Remove error messages printing out enumerations
2. Implement rule compilation to handle object references
3. Add guarded expression handling in rules
4. Support nested guarded expressions
5. Implement unary constraints
6. Create configuration file for all concrete instances, at least define them in one place
7. Complete NDDL Guide
8. Implement support for existential quanitifier on objects
9. Complete support for all temporal relations

Testing support:
1. Find a way to export initial states from Europa and translate them.
2. Ensure that all models from DDL can be converted to nddl and compiled.

System Tests:
1. Test nominal planning process - sub-goal to completion. no back-tracks.
2. Test back-tracking
3. Generate models from DDL samples, and dumn

Parallel Efforts:
1. Integration of Resources (include changes to NddlCompiler)
2. Integration of Temporal Network, including incorporation of helper methods to prune token ordering choices.
3. Add support for serialization.

PlanWorks Convergence:
1. Switch to Jam build system (evaluate at least)

Old Readme Performance Notes:
Known areas of performance improvement:
1. Object Filtering.
2. Deletion of the database.
3. Update of variables from Temporal Network.
4. Splitting merged tokens in a non-chronological backtrack.
5. Improve exchange of data in TemporalPropagator with  direct calculation of duration variables.
6. Update TemporalNetwork to adjust for deactivated constraints
