The purpose of the test definition language ("aver", for the moment) is to 
provide a mechanism by which a developer can define the attributes of and the 
behaviors during the planning process that constitute correct planning to allow 
for verification of a planner, a model, or the automatic behavior of a plan
database.
The largest unit of the test language is the Test, which amounts to
a conjunction across the assertions and Tests within the Test.  A single failed 
assertion results in a failed Test.
An assertion is a step specification followed by a single boolean statement that
examines a particular aspect of a plan or the planning behavior and asserts 
something about it. Assertions are composed of domain- and singleton-valued 
functions (described below) and a boolean operator.
The boolean operators given are '<', '>', '>=', '<=', '=', '!=', 'in', 'out', 
and 'intersects'.  The following table describes the precise semantics (I apologize if 
you aren't using a fixed-width font) 
Note 1: a 'Domain' can be either an enumeration or interval.  In the case of a 
singleton domain, the least value of the domain == the greatest value or the 
enumeration contains exactly one element.)
Note 2: any operation or operand combination that is not explicitly stated here is
undefined and will result in a test exception.

op    LHS          RHS          Semantics
-------------------------------------------------------------
<     Domain       Domain       Greatest value (GV) of LHS
                                is less than least value (LV)
                                of RHS
>     Domain       Domain       LV of LHS is greater than GV
                                of RHS
=     Interval     Interval     LV of LHS equals LV of RHS
                                and GV of LHS equals GV of RHS
      Enumeration  Enumeration  Size of LHS equals size of RHS
                                and for every element in LHS,
                                there is an equal element in
                                RHS

Note: '<=' and '>=' have the same semantics as '<' and '>', with the additional
allowances of the '=' semantics, '!=' is  simply the negation of '='

in    Enumeration  Enumeration  For every element in LHS, there is
                                an equal element in RHS
      Enumeration  Interval     Every element in LHS is greater than
                                or equal to LV of RHS and less than or
                                equal to GV of RHS
      Interval     Interval     LV of LHS is greater than or equal to

                                or equal to GV of RHS
intersects

                                which is equal to an element of

                                LV of RHS and GV of LHS is greater
                                than GV of RHS
Note: 'intersects' is symmetric
Note: 'out' is simply the negation of 'in'

The domain-valued functions are 'Tokens()', 'Objects()', and 'Transactions()',
each of which take a set of predicate assertions and return the set of entities
for which the predicate assertions hold. The values used in predicate assertions
can be explicitly defined values or domains or they can be values from other 
functions.  The type of the predicate (singleton or list) is inferred at run time
and all boolean operators have the same semantics as above.
All of the domain-valued functions return enumerated domains.

Note: A Token is essentially a temporally flexible assertion about the state of
an Object, an Object is something which can have a state, and a Transaction is 
any logged activity performed by the plan database or planner.

The following predicates are available within the Tokens() domain-valued
function:
- start     The start time of a Token  (Domain)
- end       The end time of a Token (Domain)
- duration  The duration of a Token (Domain)
- status    The status of a Token (Domain)
- predicate The name of the predicate (the state the Token represents)(Singleton)
- object    The object or objects to which the token can be attached (Domain) 
(currently unimplemented)
- variable  The parameter variable with a given name and domain. (Domain)
Note: the variable statement's syntax is as follows:
variable(name_statement value_statement)
where the name_statement is as the name predicate of an 'Objects' or 
'Transactions' assertion and value_statement is any assertion about the domain
of the variable.

The following predicates are available within the Objects() domain-valued
function:
- name      The name of the Object (Singleton)
- variable  The member variable with a given name and possibly domain. (Domain)

The following predicates are available within the Transactions() list-valued
function:
- name      The name of the Transaction (Singleton)
- object    The entity that transacted or that was transacted upon 
           (Singleton) (currently unimplemented)
- type      The type of Transaction (Singleton)


There are two singleton-valued functions, 'Count()' and 'Entity().  'Count' 
takes an enumerated domain and returns the size of the domain.  'Entity' takes
an integer index and an enumerated domain, returning the indexth element of the
domain.

Note: Entity() is currently unimplemented.

Step specifications have the format "At <qualifier>? step (<operator> <domain>)? :"
That is, the <qualifier> and (<operator> <domain>) group are optional.  There 
should be no unquoted parentheses in the step specification.
The <qualifier> can be any one of: first, last, any, each, and all.  "first" and 
"last" refer the the first and last step of planning and obviate the need for an
operator/domain group.  "each" implies that the assertion should be 
checked at every step in the specification.  "any" implies that the assertion 
need be true for only one step in the specification for the assertion to be 
considered true.  "all" treats the set of steps in the specification as an
aggregate whole.
The operator/domain group is just a boolean operator and some domain specifying
the steps for which the assertion must be true.  If the group is omitted and
"first" or "last" are not used, the assumed value will be for any step > -1.
Note: "all" is currently unimplemented

All assertions must be enclosed by a 'Test' directive, which consists of a name
and a set of assertions or other 'Test' directives.

A quick note about the small utility scripts checked into PLASMA (testlangconvert,
testlangcompile, and testlanglink):
testlangconvert is what converts from either a test language script like the one 
below to xml then to C++ or directly from xml to C++.  It will generate a two 
files of the name Test_<testfile>.[cc|hh].
testlangcompile compiles the generated C++ code to an object file for linking.
It takes one required argument, the .cc file, and one optional argument which is
passed to the compiler.  This argument is for use when PLASMA has been built 
optimized.
testlanglink has 5 arguments: the suffix of the library names (g, o, p, or some 
combination thereof), the destination executable, the model object, the test
object (as generated and compiled by testlanglink and testlangcompile), and the
runner object (i.e. runTest_g.o).  It produces an executable with the given name
which will run the tests.

An example test file follows:

Test('Test',
  At first step : Count(Tokens()) = 11;
  At any step : Count(Transactions(name = 'RETRACT_FAILED')) > 1;
  At any step : Count(Transactions(type = 'RETRACTION')) > 1;
  At any step : Count(Transactions(type = 'ASSIGNMENT')) > 1;
  At any step : Count(Transactions(type = 'RESTRICTION')) > 1;
  At step = 87 : Count(Tokens()) = 65;
  At step = 87 : Count(Tokens(predicate = 'Target.Tracked')) == 4;
  At step = 87 : Count(Tokens(start >= 3)) > 0;
  At step = 87 : Count(Tokens(end = [11..500])) = 3;
  At step = 87 : Count(Tokens(predicate = 'Target.Tracked' variable(name = 'TYPE' value = 'FLUENT'))) = 4;
  At last step : Count(Tokens()) = 65;
  Test('SubTest',
    At step = 88 : Count(Tokens()) = 65;
    Test('SubSubTest',
      At step = 34 : Count(Tokens()) != 0;
    );
  );
  Test('SubTest2',
    At step = 88 : Count(Tokens()) = 65;
    Test('SubSubTest2',
      At step = 34 : Count(Tokens()) != 0;
      Test('SubSubSubTest2',
        At step = 13 : Count(Tokens()) in [0..10000];
      );
    );
  );
  Test('DepthTest1',
    Test('DepthTest2',
      Test('DepthTest3',
        Test('DepthTest4',
          Test('DepthTest5',
            Test('DepthTest6',
              At any step : 1 != 0;
            );
          );
        );
      );
    );
  );
);
