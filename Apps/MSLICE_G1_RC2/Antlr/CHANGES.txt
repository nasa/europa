Changes with Antlr 2.7.6

# Terence Parr
o added size, index methods to TokenStreamRewriteEngine.java

o bug in syn preds for tree parsers.  Submitted by Ole Kniemeyer.

o all Class.forName yanked out; uses thread context loader

o option to prevent System.exit termination

o added recover() method to lexers

o fixed code gen bug for syn preds in tree parsers.  Thanks to Marc Horowitz.

o BaseAST was not checking for null text in toString()

o Scott added java line ouput in code gen

o Prashant tweaked a few things for ANTLRStudio; a few new classes in ASdebug package

# Ric Klaren:

- Give errors if the user attempts to set k>1 in a TreeWalker

- Added missing Makefile.in for C++ heteroAST example and enabled it
  in configure.in

- Many small C++ support code and codegen tweaks fixes to increase
  portability. (Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.1, VC's)

- Prevent '\' entering the bitset dump comments, might occur at end of
  line. Some compilers continue the comment to the next line (not sure
  if this is a compiler bug, should look it up)

For the thanks & kudos:

Among others thanks to Stuart Dootson, Bryan Ewbank, Kurt McCall and
a number of others who submitted patches. (my administration wasn't too
well this time)

# Changes for C# support (by Kunle Odutola & Micheal Jordan):

-- Fixed isssue where an empty input stream caused an exception in the lexer
due to the
   caching of LA1 and LA2. StringTemplate triggers this.

-- The rewind() method did not take into account the value of the case
insensitive flag.
   Reported by Dr. Hartmut Kocher.

--  ***BREAKING CHANGE*** ASTPair object pool had a race condition in
multi-threaded
    environments. ASTPair is now a struct.

--  C# examples now properly initialize the ASTFactory before a tree parser
is used.
