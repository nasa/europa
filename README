A: CVS checkout:

For CVS, /usr/local/bin (Code TC SPARCs) or /usr/bin (Linux) 
should be in your PATH.
  
1. Latest development state:
   > cvs co PLASMA or
   > cvs update PLASMA
2. Latest tagged milestone:
   > cvs co -r "EUROPA2_20050404_0" PLASMA 


B: Getting started:

In this section we provide brief details on how to get up an running
with Europa2 (informally known as PLASMA by the development team), and
give pointers to more detailed documentation to assist in the process.

1. Building Europa2

See the file 'BUILDING', also in the PLASMA directory, for instructions on 
how to build Europa2. The 'BUILDING' file includes:

    - a list of prerequisite programs and their locations
    - a procedure to quickly build Europa2 with default variant and 
      libraries
    - a list of required environment variable settings 
    - detailed explanations of build variant and library options

2. Ensuring the system is working correctly.

Once you have successfully built Europa2, run 'jam run-all-tests'.
This will build and execute a significant number of module and system
tests.

Ignore messages from the PartialPlanWiter warning that PPW_CONFIG is
not set or is empty.

3. Creating your own project

See file 'HELLOWORLD' in the PLASMA directory to get started on your own
project. The 'HELLOWORLD' file includes:

    - step by step instructions to execute a script that will create a
      project directory and and populate it with a build setup, 
      initial model, initial state.
    - an executable that is built and executed, resulting in a plan.
    - instructions on how to configure the Europa2 transaction logger
      for use by the visualization software.
    - instruction to create a PlanWorks project that includes
      the resulting plan (See section C, PlanWorks, below for how 
      to get started with PlanWorks).
    - instructions on how to visualize your plan with PlanWorks.
    - instructions on how to control running the CBPlanner from PlanWorks.


C. PlanWorks - recommended for visualization and debugging.

   Once you have built a plan using Europa2, you will want to visualize
   your plan. You may want to search for errors in your model or in
   the initial state and goals. PlanWorks visualizes the relationships 
   between entities such as variables, rules, and activities. It can
   visualize plans with thousands of steps, variables, and constraints.
   PlanWorks is implemented in Java and MySQL and uses a transaction 
   logger called the PartialPlanWriter supplied in the standard Europa2
   build.

   Getting started with PlanWorks:
   
   - CVS Checkout

   1. Latest development state:
   > cvs co PlanWorks or
   > cvs update PlanWorks
   2. Latest tagged milestone:
   > cvs co -r PW_M_18 PlanWorks

   - Installing and using PlanWorks

   Follow the directions in the PlanWorks README and GETTING_STARTED
   files, found in the PlanWorks directory, to install and use PlanWorks.

   Follow directions in the file 'HELLOWORLD' to create a sample
   PlanWorks project and add a project sequence. Some configuration is 
   required to enable the PartialPlanWriter logger. This is also detailed
   in the file 'HELLOWORLD'.

E. Known Issues

See GNATS reports filed in the PLASMA category under Query at:

http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=ic-gnats

The Europa GNATS category is for the "prequel" project, now referred
to as Europa1 and/or NewPlan (after the CVS repository it is stored
in).

F. Troubleshooting

Please report any issues or problems using "Create" at the GNATS URL
just above.  For crashes, gdb backtraces are very helpful.
