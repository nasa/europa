/** * @defgroup TemporalNetwork * <A NAME="tn_overview"><H3>Temporal Network Overview</H3></A> * * The temporal network is responsible for efficiently ensuring * consistency with temporal constraints.  To use the temporal * network, one instantiates a TemporalPropagator, which will * register itself with a supplied constraint engine.  One can * attach a listener to the temporal network in order to monitor * events in the temporal network.  There is also a special * purpose temporal advisor defined for @ref stp "STP" * as part of the TemporalNetwork module. * * <A NAME="tn_entry"><H4>API</H4></A> * * The main class in the temporal network is the  * TemporalPropagator.  Instantiating the TemporalPropagator * will create a TemporalNetwork.  It will also associate * the propagator with the given constraint engine. *  * The temporal network can be monitored by adding a * TemporalNetworkListener to the TemporalPropagator. * The temporal network can be queried through four * reader functions defined on TemporalPropagator. * * Other key classes include the TemporalConstraints: * @li TemporalDistanceConstraint - (source, distance, destination) * @li PrecedesConstraint - (source, destination) * @li ConcurrentConstraint - (source, destination) * These need to be registered using REGISTER_CONSTRAINT, * before usage. * * <A NAME="tn_use"><H4>Using the Temporal Network API</H4></A> * * The "testTemporalPropagation" in the TemporalNetwork module * tests provides a good example of how to instantiate and use the * TemporalNetwork. * * <A NAME="tn_history"><H4>History</H4></A> * * A substantial amount of the temporal network is code that has * been migrated from Europa1.  This comprises the core of the * temporal network, including an implementation of a distance * graph, dispatch graph, and the temporal network itself. * * New code that integrates the temporal network into the new * framework is defined in the components of the module.  This * includes most of the classes mentioned in the overview.  The * components of this module demonstrate how to augment system * behavior through inheritance. * @li STNTemporalAdvisor from DefaultTemporalAdvisor * @li TemporalPropagator from Propagator * @li TemporalDistanceConstraint from AddEqualConstraint * * <A NAME="tn_class_diagrams"><H4>Class Diagrams</H4></A> * * @image html temporal-network-uml-class-diagram.jpg Distance Graph and Temporal Network. * * @image html temporal-network-collaborators.jpg Temporal Network Collaboration Diagram */
