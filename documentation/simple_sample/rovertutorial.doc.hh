/** * @page rovertutorial A Simple Sample Application (The Planetary Rover) * This tutorial will step you through a simple EUROPA2 application to provide you with a solid understanding * of the capabilities of EUROPA2 and how to approach the modeling application domains.  * We begin by introducing the goal of the sample application before stepping * through the stages of creating a EUROPA2 application for it. * * * @section rovertutorialapplicatonbackground Overview of the Simple Planetary Rover Application * *  NASA's Mars Exploratory Rover (MER) mission is operating two rovers on the surface of Mars. The rovers are *  moving to points of interest identified by scientists on earth *  to collect a range of scientific data by placing instruments and transmitting the  *  produced data back to earth. We are going to write the planning application for controlling a simplified  * version of these rovers.  * * To provide some context, the figure below shows NASA Ames' K9 rover that is used to experiment with advanced control concepts  * for future Mars rover missions. K9 is operating in a simulated * Martian landscape (called Marscape) where it mirrors the MER mission. The first pictures shows K9 in the context of its environments. * * @image html k9-rover-overview-photo.jpg K9 Rover at NASA Ames' Marscape while controlled by a EUROPA2 planner * * The second picture shows K9 placing its sensor on a rock.  *  * @image html k9-sensor-on-rock-photo.jpg K9 Rover Placing a sensor at NASA Ames' Marscape  * * We will build a batch application where we provide an application domain model  * and problem definition to the planner. The planner must then generate a plan to solve the problem. The figure below shows the main inputs and outputs. * * @image html simple-sample-overview.jpg Application overview * * @section rovertutorialdomainanalysis Application Domain Analysis * * Developing EUROPA2 applications is a design task that will require judgment and multiple iterations.  * We will follow the steps in this tutorial that we have  * found useful in practice. The overall approach is to gradually build up a domain description  * adding detail methodically. This approach controls complexity by allowing * the domain writer to focus only on well defined issues at a given instant.   * * The first stage is to draw a concept map of the entities in the application domain and their relationships. The figure below shows our concept map for the rover domain. We have * identified locations and the paths between them as the key environment entities. The rover itself has been divided in subcomponents. The navigator concept manages the  * location of the rover. The instrument concept will manage the instruments for sampling rocks and the commands concept looks after instructions from the scientists that  * the rover will serve. Finally the battery concept is included to provide a place for managing the power used by the other components of the rover. The Lander corresponds to the vehicle used to deliver the  * rover to the planet surface. The Lander also provides a communication service that the rover can use * to transmit information to earth.  *  * @image html rover-application-concept-diagram.jpg Rover Application Concept Diagram *  * The next decision is to identify the entities that will describe changes in state of the rover as it moves around its environment and performs experiments. We call each property a <i>timeline</i>. The concept is * best introduced by example.  The rover in our domain is the  * actor we will be planning for and will contain all the timelines. Analyzing the components of the rover produces the following breakdown of timelines * <ul> * <li> <b>Navigator</b> controls the rover's movement between locations and holding position at a location * <li> <b>Instrument</b> controls the scientific instrument on the rover * <li> <b>Commands</b> manages instructions from the scientist controlling the rover.  * </ul> * * The next stage is to identify the states that each timeline can be in. We call each state a <i>predicate</i>.  * The easiest way to identify the predicates * is to think through the lifecycle of each timeline. The following figure shows the set of predicates we have identified on each timeline. * * @image html rover-tutorial-initial-timelines.jpg Initial Timelines and Predicates * * Working from the top of the figure downwards  * <ul> * <li><b>Navigator</b> The rover is <i>at</i> a location or it <i>going</i> between locations.  * <li><b>Instrument</b> The instrument can be stowed away and can be in the state of being stowed or being unstowed. The instrument may also be placed on a target where it can then * take a sample * <li><b>Commands</b> The rover can be instructed to take a sample or to upload its data to the lander or directly to earth.  *</ul> * As noted earlier, identifying the timelines and predicates is an iterative process. It would not be unusual to find new timelines while identifying predicates or to  * discover that two timelines could be collapsed into one. Please iterate and be comfortable with experimentation. * * The next stage is to flesh out the properties of the predicates and the constraints between them. Lets begin by adding these elements to the figure above (we've  * omitted the properties of the instrument's predicates for clarity). We focus initial on just the transitions between predicates within a timeline not the constraints * between predicates on different timelines. The black circle indicates a startup state for the timeline * while the black circle with an outer circle indicates a terminal state.  * * @image html rover-tutorial-navigation-timeline.jpg Timelines and Predicates with Transitions between Predicates on each Timeline.  * * The meaning of the state transitions added to this figure are intuitive. The next stage is to consider the constraints between predicates on different time lines.  * So far we have only used the notion state transitions to connect predicates. These map to the temporal relations of <i>meets</i> and <i>met by</i> and are sufficient * for a timelines where only one predicate instance can occur at any given moment. When we start to connect predicates between timelines we need to use the full range * of temporal relations as we begin to deal with concurrent states.  * * @image html rover-tutorial-timeline-interaction.jpg Iterations Between Timelines. *  * We have only one interaction between timelines in this application. The <i>take sample</i> predicate requires that the navigation timeline be <i>at</i> the location  * throughout its lifetime. We are identifying the common sense constraint that we have to be at and remain at a location in order to sample it.  * * We now have the main concepts in the application identified and categorized and we are ready to start encoding it in NDDL.  * * @section rovertutorialnddl NDDL Encoding - Model *  * Our encoding of the Rover domain is available in the <i>Examples/SimpleRover</i> directory. We will step through each of the model files and explain how it was derived * form our analysis above and the NDDL constructs that were used. <i>SimpleRover-model.nddl</i> contains the application domain model and <i>SimleRover-inital-state.nddl</i> * contains the sample problem definitions.  * * We begin with the application domain model. The first two lines are include statements. NDDL allows us to develop module domain descriptions where elements are put into separate files. * This allows us to reuse model elements between applications and to control the complexity by showing only related elements in a given * file. In this example, we are include two files that make available some default NDDL structures. Please for the moment ignore the detail of the * included files  and just note that it is possible to include files.   * * <code> * #include "../../NDDL/core/Plasma.nddl"<br> * #include "../../NDDL/core/PlannerConfig.nddl" * </code> * * @subsection locations Defining Locations * The concept of locations is encoded in the <i>location</i> class.  * The class has three attributes. The <i>name</i> is a symbolic name for the location. The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> * attributes are coordinates. We have decided to position all our locations on a Euclidean Plane. The second part of the class specifies the constructor. The constructor defines * how the attributes of a location are initialized when a new instance is created. We are simply providing a signature that allows us to create locations with the name * and coordinates specified. The constructor's job is simply to copy those initial values into the correct member variables.  * * <code> *  class Location { <br> * string name; <br> * int x; <br> * int y; <br> *  * Location(string _name, int _x, int _y){ <br> *  name = _name; <br> *  x = _x; <br> *  y = _y; <br> * }  <br> *} <br> * </code> * @subsection path Defining Paths * The <i>Path</i> class follows a similar pattern to the <i>Location</i> class. Paths have a symbolic name and a * pair of locations that they connect. The <i>cost</i> parameter will be used to compute the amount of battery * power that will be consumed while traversing a path. The constructor's role is again just to take initial  * values for each of a <i>path's</i> attributes. * * <code> * class Path { <br> * string name; <br> * Location from; <br> * Location to; <br> * float cost; <br> * <br> * Path(string _name, Location _from, Location _to, float _cost){ // constructor <br> *  name = _name; <br> *  from = _from; <br> *   to = _to; <br> *   cost = _cost; <br> * } <br> *} <br> * </code> * * @subsection resource Defining Resources * We next encode the <i>Battery</i> that will be used to power the rover. EUROPA2 provides a <i>Resource</i> class for modeling items like batteries and * fuel cells that have a numeric capacity that is produced and consumed during a plan. The <i>Battery</i> class specializes the general <i>Resource</i> class. * It takes four arguments. An initial capacity <i>ic</i>, a minimum charge level <i>ll_min</i> and a maximum charge level <i>ll_max</i>. The <i>Battery</i> * constructor delegates the creation of an instance to its parent or super class, the general <i>Resource</i> class.  * *<code> * class Battery extends Resource { <br> *  Battery(float ic, float ll_min, float ll_max){ <br> *   super(ic, ll_min, ll_max, 0.0, 0.0, MINUS_INFINITY, MINUS_INFINITY);  <br> *  } <br> *} <br> *</code> * * @subsection rover Defining the Navigator Timeline * We now move on to encode the components of the rover. Lets begin with the rover's navigator. This class contains the two predicates we identified earlier. * The <i>At</i> predicate models the concept of the rover being at a particular location. The <i>Going</i> predicate models the concept of moving between * locations. The <i>neq</i> construct is a constraint that ensures the rover does not attempt to traverse a path that start and finishes in the same location. *  * <code> * class Navigator <br> * {<br> *   predicate At{<br> *     Location location; <br> * } <br> * <br> *  predicate Going{<br> *  Location from; <br> *  Location to; <br> *  neq(from, to); // prevents rover from going from a location straight back to that location. <br> *  } <br> * } <br> * </code> *  * The next element encodes the detail of the <i>At</i> predicate. The first constraint is a <i>met_by</i> that specifies instances of this predicate will be * proceeded by an instance of the <i>Going</i> predicate. We name that predecessor as <i>from</i>. We then post the constraint that the <i>from</i> predicate's * <i>to</i> attribute is equal to the <i>location</i> attribute of this predicate. We are just saying that a preceding <i>Going</i> predicate must end at * the location of this <i>At</i>. The third constraint specifies that an <i>At</i> predicate will be followed by a <i>Going</i> predicate. That <i>from</i> * location of that succeeding <i>Going</i> predicate must be set this location.  * * <code> * Navigator::At{ <br> * met_by(object.Going from); <br> * eq(from.to, location); // next Going token starts at this location<br> * meets(object.Going to); <br> * eq(to.from, location); // prevous Going token ends at this location<br> * }</code> * * We next specify the details of the <i>Going</i> predicate. It first mirrors the <i>At</i> predicates constraints in ensuring that a <i>Going</i> * is always preceded and followed by a <i>At</i> predicate and that the <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> attributes are synchronized correctly. The <i>Path</i> * element models the constraint that <i>Going</i> predicate must pass along a path that connects to locations being traversed. Finally, the battery * components specifies that the change in battery level caused by a <i>Going</i> predicate is equal to the cost associated with the path selected.  * * <code> * Navigator::Going{ <br> * met_by(object.At _from); <br> * eq(_from.location, from); <br> * meets(object.At _to); <br> * eq(_to.location, to);  <br> * <br> * Path p;<br> * eq(p.from, from); <br> * eq(p.to, to); <br> * <br> * starts(Battery.change tx); <br> * eq(tx.quantity, p.cost); <br> *} <br> * </code> *  * @subsection commands Defining the Commands Timeline * * The Commands timeline manages instructions from the scientist user to take samples (<i>TakeSample</i>) or transmit information * back to the lander (<i>PhoneLander</i>) or earth (<i>PhoneEarth</i>).  * * <code> * class Commands{ <br> * predicate TakeSample{ <br> *  Location rock; <br> *  eq(duration, [20 25]); // restrict the token's duration to between 20 and 25 time units <br> * } <br> *    * predicate PhoneHome{} <br> *   * predicate PhoneLander{} <br>  * } <br> * </code> * * The next element details the constraint on each of the <i>Commands</i> class' predicates. Lets take <i>TakeSample</i> first. Much of the definition * will be familiar to you from the previous predicates. The <i>contains</i> constraint ensures that an <i>Instrument</i> class' <i>TakeSample</i> action * must occur at sometime during this predicate. The next line names the rock that that sample will occur at as <i>rock</i>. The condition allows the predicate to either meet  * a <i>PhoneHome</i> or <i>PhoneLander</i> predicate to transmit the results of the  * sampling back to earth. Either way can be used by the planner unless we set specify the value of the <i>OR</i> variable.  *  * <code> * Commands::TakeSample{ <br> * contains(Instrument.TakeSample a); <br> * eq(a.rock, rock);  <br> * Rover rovers; <br> * <br> * bool OR; <br> * <br> * if(OR == false){ <br> *  meets(object.PhoneHome t0); <br> * }<br> * if(OR == true){ <br> *  meets(object.PhoneLander t1); <br> * } <br> * } <br> * </code> * * The <i>PhoneHome</i> and <i>PhoneLander</i> predicates are specified next. Both * use battery power. <i>PhoneHome</i> is more expensive as the signal needs to be transmitted back to earth requiring much more power.   * * <code> *Commands::PhoneHome{ <br> * starts(Battery.change tx); <br> * eq(tx.quantity, -600); // consume battery power<br> *} <br> * <br> *Commands::PhoneLander{ <br> *starts(Battery.change tx); <br> *eq(tx.quantity, -20); // consume battery power<br> *} <br> *</code> * * @subsection instrument Defining the Instrument Timeline * This timeline details the management of the rover's instruments for taking samples and for keeping the instrument safely stowed while moving.   * The first predicate is <i>TakeSample</i> and it is constrained to take at most ten time units. * * <code> * class Instrument{ <br> * predicate TakeSample{ <br> * Location rock; <br> * leq(10, duration); // duration of TakeSample is between 0 and 10 time units<br> * } <br> * </code> * * <i>Place</i> models the process of putting the instrument on the rock once the rover has driven up to it. This is constrained to take between three and  * twelve time units.  * *<code> * predicate Place{ <br> *  Location rock; <br> *  eq([3 12], duration); // duration of Place is between 3 and 12 time units<br> * } <br> *</code> * * We then model the actions for stowing the instrument safely and for the actions of stowing it and unstowing it. Both actions take between two and six time units. * * <code> *predicate Stow{ <br> * eq([2 6], duration); // duration of Stow is between 2 and 6 time units<br> *} <br> * * predicate Unstow{ <br> * eq([2 6], duration); // duration of Unstow is between 2 and 6 time units<br> *} <br> * * predicate Stowed{} <br> * } <br> *</code> * * With the predicates defined we now move on to specify the detailed constraints on each beginning with <i>TakeSample</i>. We first constrain the predicate * to occur while the rover's navigator it at the location of the rock.  The action must be proceeded by a <i>Place</i> predicate and succeeded by a <i>Stow</i> predicate. The predicate * consumes one hundred and twenty units of battery power.  * * <code> * Instrument::TakeSample{ <br> * contained_by(Navigator.At at); <br> * eq(at.location, rock); <br> * Rover rovers; <br> * <br> * met_by(Place b); <br> * eq(b.rock, rock); <br> * <br> * meets(Stow c); <br> * <br> * starts(Battery.change tx); <br> * eq(tx.quantity, -120); // consume battery power <br> * } <br> * </code> * * The <i>Place</i> predicate is similar to the <i>TakeSample</i> predicate.  * * <code> * Instrument::Place{<br> * contained_by(Navigator.At at); <br> * eq(at.location, rock); <br> * Rover rovers;<br> * <br> * meets(TakeSample a);<br> * eq(a.rock, rock);<br> * met_by(Unstow b); <br> * <br> * starts(Battery.change tx); <br> * eq(tx.quantity, -20); // consume battery power<br> * }  <br>* </code>** <i>Unstow</i> ensures that it only occurs while the navigator is stationary and it is proceeded by a <i>Stowed</i> predicate as it is not possible to * unstow the instrument from any other state.** <code>* Instrument::Unstow{ <br>*  contained_by(Navigator.At at);  <br>* Rover rovers;  <br>*  <br>* meets(Place a);  <br>*  met_by(Stowed b);  <br>*  <br>* starts(Battery.change tx);  <br>* eq(tx.quantity, -20); // consume battery power <br>* }  <br>* </code>* * The <i>Stow</i> predicate ensure that is followed by a <i>Stowed</i> predicate and succeeds a <i>TakeSample</i> predicate.  ** <code>* Instrument::Stow{  <br>* contained_by(Navigator.At at);  <br>*  Rover rovers;  <br>*  <br>*  meets(Stowed a);  <br>*  met_by(TakeSample b);  <br>*  <br>* starts(Battery.change tx);  <br>* eq(tx.quantity, -20);  // consume batter power <br>* }  <br>*</code> ** <i>Stowed</i> just ensures that it sits between <i>Stow</i> and <i>Unstow</i> predicates. ** <code>* Instrument::Stowed{ <br>*  met_by(Stow a); <br>*  meets(Unstow b); <br>* } <br> * </code>** @subsection therover Defining the Rover ** The <i>Rover</i> class pulls together all the components we have defined so far. It has an attribute for the navigator, instrument, and * battery classes. The constructer takes an instance of the Battery class and creates instances of the other classes to setup the rover. ** <code>* class Rover {  <br>* Commands commands;  <br>*  Navigator navigator;  <br>*  Instrument instrument;  <br>*  Battery mainBattery;  <br>*   <br>*  Rover(Battery r){  <br>*  commands = new Commands();  <br>*  navigator = new Navigator();  <br>*  instrument = new Instrument();  <br>*   mainBattery = r; <br>*  } <br>*} <br>*</code>** We have now completed the NDDL modeling we need to describe our application domain and it is now possible to describe problems that we want our planner to * solve.** @section rovertutorialnddlinitalState NDDL Encoding - Initial State** The initial state file contains an example planning problem with a specific set of locations and paths. The first line of the file just includes the domain* model file we detailed in the previous section. ** <code>* #include "./SimpleRover-model.nddl"* </code>** The <i>PlannerConfig</i> sets the planning horizon to between 0 and 100 units and gives the planner 600 search steps to search for a solution. ** <code>* PlannerConfig world = new PlannerConfig(0, 100, 600);* </code>** The environment is configured to have five locations - four rocks and a single lander. * * <code>* Location lander = new Location("LANDER", 0, 0); <br>* Location rock1 = new Location("ROCK1", 9, 9); <br>* Location rock2 = new Location("ROCK2", 1, 6); <br>* Location rock3 = new Location("ROCK3", 4, 8); <br>* Location rock4 = new Location("ROCK4", 3, 9); <br>* </code>** We define three paths that lead from the lander to the location named <i>rock4</i>. The paths* vary considerably in the amount of battery energy needed to traverse them. ** <code>* Path p1 = new Path("Very Long Way", lander, rock4, -2000.0); <br>* Path p2 = new Path("Moderately Long Way", lander, rock4, -1500.0); <br>* Path p3 = new Path("Short Cut", lander, rock4, -400.0); <br>* </code>** We define a single battery with an initial and maximum capacity of 1000 units. The battery may be drained as low as 0 units.** <code>* Battery battery = new Battery(1000.0, 0.0, 1000.0); <br>* </code>** We define a single rover, <i>spirit</i> and pass it the battery we just defined. ** <code>* Rover spirit = new Rover(battery); <br>* </code>** We have now defined all the objects in our domain and we can close both the database and begin specifying the state of the world.** <code>* Resource.close(); <br>* close(); <br>* </code>** We define the initial state by creating an <i>At</i> token called <i>initialPosition</i>. It is constrained to start at the same time the* planning horizon starts and the location attribute is set to being the <i>lander</i>. The result is to place the rover at the lander at time zero.* * <code>* goal(Navigator.At initialPosition); <br>* eq(initialPosition.start, world.m_horizonStart);<br>* eq(initialPosition.location, lander); <br>* </code>** We define the goal as taking a sample of <i>rock4</i> starting at time 50. * * <code>* goal(Commands.TakeSample sample); <br>* sample.start.specify(50); <br>* sample.rock.specify(rock4); <br>*</code>* * The initial state is completed by setting the initial state of the instrument to stowed. **<code>rejectable(Instrument.Stowed stowed); <br>eq(stowed.start, world.m_horizonStart); <br></code>** With the objects in our world setup and the goal the planner is to bring about specified it is time to start planning. The next section traces* the operation of EUROPA2's planner on this problem.* * @section rovertutorialplanning Planning * * Under Construction * @image html solver-main-control-loop.jpg Solver Main Control Loop (simplified) * * @section rovertuotrialsummary Summary * * You are now familiar with the process of analyzing an application domain and encoding it in NDDL and tracing the operation of the planner on it.  * This completes the introductory tutorial for EUROPA2.
